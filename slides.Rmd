# Collective Efficacy

*Collective efficacy is a problem-solving capacity that explains why crime is concentrated in certain neighbourhoods: it influences social control* <sup>1</sup> 

<br>

???

In places high in CE, people intervene for the public good which includes informal social control

---
# The Built Environment

*The built environment explains why crime is concentrated in particular places within neighbourhoods: it influences opportunity* <sup>1</sup>

???

I use routine activities but general idea similar with other opportunity frameworks---some features lead to more criminogenic situations

---
# The Thesis

*Given that...*

* Residents recognize some features of the built environment cause crime <sup>1</sup>

   * e.g., abandoned buildings, bars, vacant lots

.footnote[[1] Innes 2004 [2] Donnelly & Kimball 1997 [3] Sampson 2012 [4] Logan & Molotch 1987]

--

* Residents act collectively to address these problems <sup>2</sup>

--

* Collective efficacy makes collective action more frequent and effective <sup>3</sup>

--

* The built environment changes slowly, for physical and institutional reasons <sup>4</sup>

--

**Neighbourhoods with high collective efficacy in the past will have low crime in the present because they prevented and removed criminogenic features of the built environment.**

# Theoretical Model

.image-center[
![](img/1_basic_model.svg)
]

Hypotheses:

* H1: Some present built environment features are criminogenic

* H2: Past collective efficacy reduces present criminogenic built environment features

* H3: Criminogenic features weaken present collective efficacy

* Implied: No effect of past collective efficacy on present crime

# Chicago Data


.pull-left[
Key Sources:

* PHDCN Community Survey
* Chicago Community Adult Health Study
   * 8 built environment features
* Chicago Police Department reported crimes
   * Homicide / Gun Violence
   * Robbery
   * All violent crime
   * All property crime

Units:
* 1641 blocks nested in 343 neighbourhood clusters

# Methods

.image-center[
![](img/2_longitudinal_models.svg)
]


* Hierarchical measurement models for collective efficacy

* Piecewise structural equations to test hypotheses

   * Mix of hierarchical negative binomial and linear regressions
   * D-separation tests of past collective efficacy and present crime


---
# Key Results

* *H1: Some present built environment features are criminogenic*

   * Abandoned buildings predict mainly homicide/gun assault and violence
   * Commerce predicts robbery, violence, and property crimes

--

* *H2: Past collective efficacy reduces present criminogenic built environment features*

   * Past collective efficacy predicts fewer abandoned buildings, commercial destinations, mixed land use, and vacant lots.

--

* *H3: Criminogenic features weaken present collective efficacy*

   * No built environment features predict present collective efficacy

---
# Contributions

Implications for control of the built environment:

* Promotes neighbourhood stability, health, and quality of life
* Implicates collective efficacy in segregation, concentrated disadvantage, and public (dis)investment

--

Integrates collective efficacy with existing theory:

* Criminal opportunity (e.g., Cohen & Felson 1979)
* Political economy of place (e.g. Logan & Molotch 1987)
* Public social control (e.g. Bursik 1989; Velez 2001)

--

Sets up future research:

* Vertical theoretical integration---from political economy to the situation
* Conditions and methods for action to impact built environment
   * Government and institutional responsiveness
   * Points of intervention
